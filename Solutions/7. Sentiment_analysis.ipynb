    "You can the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create two lists, named `positive_words` and `negative_words`.\n",
    "2. Tokenise the text file, and calculate the score for positivity and the score for negativity for each of these words. \n",

This specific task can be performed using the function `sortedByValue()`, defined below. This function can opionally be used with a parameter named `ascending`. If the value of this parameter is `False`, the values will be sorted in a descending order. "
